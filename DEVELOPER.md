# Design Guidelines
1. Minimise sharp edges, use curves wherever possible
2. Refer to: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/visual-design, regardless of the platform.
3. Use GIMP or some other FOSS for creating logos. This allows everyone to easily edit the image (we don't want contribution behind a paywall if you use Adobe Illustrate, for example)

# We need help
I have no idea how to do this
